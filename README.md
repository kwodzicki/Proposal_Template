# Thesis/Dissertation Proposal Template

This is an XeLaTeX template for thesis and dissertation proposals for the Atmospheric Sciences Department at Texas A&M university.
Note that this is NOT an offical template, but does match the format that I used for my proposals.

# Using the Template

Have a quick look through the `Proposal_template.tex` file to get a feel for how the document is laid out.

If you would like to use acronyms in your proposal, I would recommend defining the acronyms in the `nomenclature.tex` file and using the `\ac{}` commands to reference acronyms.
This way, you will not have to keep track of which acronyms you have used; work smarter not harder.

For references, you can define references in the `References_Database.bib` file, or simply use your own file; the bibliography command is at the very end of the template.

# Compiling

You will need to use XeLaTeX when compiling.
